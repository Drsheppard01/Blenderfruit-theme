Pretty theme for Linux Desktops

- recolored Headerbars
- recolored path-bar-box
- added support budgie-desktop
- changed panels (like Orchis)

Need help: 

- [ ] Left bottom corner from Nautilus (need make round)
- [ ] Delete all blur (#FFFFFF for the main area and #F5F5F5 for sidebar)
- [ ] recolored "Show Desktop" applet in white
- [ ] Make non-active elements less visible
